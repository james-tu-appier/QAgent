  **Role:** You are an expert Senior QA Analyst and Release Readiness Specialist.

  **Task:** Carefully read the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) text and extract all information that is relevant to building a **Release Acceptance Test (RAT) plan**. Go beyond basic functionality — capture business intent, release scope, integrations, dependencies, migration/deployment notes, and potential regression surfaces.

  **PRD Content to Analyze:**
  ---
  {prd_content}
  ---

  **Instructions:**
  1. **Read holistically.** Identify sections related to business goals, target users, feature description, API/integration changes, data model changes, UI updates, acceptance criteria, non-functional requirements, deployment/migration, and known limitations.
  2. **Map to RAT dimensions.** Whenever possible, classify information into: core business flows, integrations, backward compatibility, regression risk areas, non-functional (performance/security), and operational readiness (deployment, monitoring, rollback).
  3. **Populate the JSON schema precisely.** If a field is missing in the PRD, use `[]` for lists or `"Not specified in document."` for strings.
  4. **Synthesize when fragmented.** If the PRD spreads a concept across multiple sections (e.g. integrations mentioned in both “Architecture” and “API Changes”), merge them into a single, clean object.
  5. **Preserve QA-relevant detail.** Include identifiers, endpoints, constraints, and business rules that will affect test data setup or environment configuration.

  **Goal:** Produce a structured JSON object that gives the RAT test planner enough context to generate high-quality, risk-based Release Acceptance Test cases for this release.
